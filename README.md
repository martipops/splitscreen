# Splitscreen Support

Simple mod that makes it easier to position windows for local multiplayer.

With this mod installed, hitting the 'Toggle Fullscreen' button (F11) will cycle you through different half- and quarter-size
window positions for split screen play.  It then saves your choice and brings the window up in the same place when you
restart the game. 

This makes it easier for you to start two or more copies of Minecraft and have the windows be positioned automatically 
for splitscreen.
